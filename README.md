sguallino
=========

Sguallino is an old program. Unfortunately the code and comments are in Spanish, as 
I was not good at all at English when I wrote it. I have translated some parts, and 
if I ever have the time/willpower, I might translate more.

The idea of the progrma is to evaluate aminoacidic sequence alignments for homology
modelling. Sguallino takes the alignment in fasta format and other files with 
information about the structure and similar date of the protein. It formats things
nicely so problems with the alignment are easily seen. It also produces a PDB where
the quality of the alignment of each part of the sequence is signaled in the b-factor
of each atom, and insertions/deletions are signaled with ions.

If you ever need it and cannot use it due to the Spanish comments/code, drop me a line,
I may fix it if I happen to have the time at the moment.
